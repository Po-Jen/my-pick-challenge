1.Download the processed model from http://rll.berkeley.edu/amazon_picking_challenge/
2.Transform the .stl file to .dae file (because Gazebo only takes .dae or .stl for model's mesh)
  you can do this by meshlab
3.cd ~/.gazebo/models
4.mkdir cheezit_big_original && cd cheezit_big_original
5.mkdir meshes
6.copy the mesh and png file into meshes
7.copy other model's model.sdf and model.config into cheezit_big_original
8.Modify model.sdf 
  -Pay attention to the pose (see Q1)
  -Pay attention to the scale (see Q2)
9.Modify model.config
10.Load the model in Gazebo


Q1: How to decide the pose of model so that the model will not collide with the floor?
A:  Let the pose be <pose>0 0 0 0 0 0</pose> 

Q2: How to decide the inertia of the object?
